# Retail Sales SQL Analytics

End-to-end **SQL analysis** of a synthetic European e-commerce retailer (~4,000 customers,
18,000 orders, 30,000 order lines across 2023–2024). The project answers the questions a
business stakeholder actually asks — *Is revenue growing? What sells? Who are our best
customers? Are we keeping them?* — using nothing but SQL.

##  Data model

```
customers ──< orders ──< order_items >── products
```

| Table | Grain | Key columns |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `customers`   | one row per customer | `customer_id`, `signup_date`, `country`, `acquisition_channel` |
| `products`    | one row per product  | `product_id`, `category`, `unit_price` |
| `orders`      | one row per order    | `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `status` |
| `order_items` | one row per line     | `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `unit_price` |

**Revenue convention:** only `status = 'completed'` orders count; line revenue = `quantity × unit_price`.

## Key findings

- **Strong, steady growth.** Monthly revenue climbed from a near-zero launch to **€460k by
  Dec 2024**, with total revenue of **€5.6M** across the period and an **average order value of €355**.
- **Revenue is highly concentrated.** Electronics alone drives **57%** of revenue; the top two
  categories account for **70%** — a classic Pareto distribution that tells the merchandising
  team where to focus.
- **A small group of "Champions" carries the business.** RFM segmentation surfaces high-value,
  highly-engaged customers (e.g. 27 orders / €13k lifetime) alongside an **"At Risk (high value)"**
  segment — customers who used to spend heavily but have gone quiet and are worth a win-back campaign.
- **Retention stabilises around 20–30%.** Cohort analysis shows new customers settle into a
  repeat-purchase rate of roughly a quarter after the first month — a realistic e-commerce curve
  and a baseline to improve against.

##  SQL techniques

| Technique | Where |
|-----------|-------|
| Multi-table `JOIN` + filtered aggregation | every query |
| `CTE` chaining for readable pipelines | 02, 03, 04, 05 |
| `LAG()` for Month-over-Month growth | 02 |
| `RANK()` + running total / share-of-total | 03 |
| `NTILE()` quintile scoring + `CASE` segmentation | 04 (RFM) |
| First-touch cohort + month-offset retention | 05 |
